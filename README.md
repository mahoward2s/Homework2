# Responsive Portfolio

<!--Description of the Repository-->
This is a website I created linking 3 HTML files and Bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio.
The three HTML pages are linked via a navbar and the website is responsive to different screen sizes and phones.
The portfolio portion shows some of the collection I have.
